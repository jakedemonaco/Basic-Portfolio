				<p class="Order66">Hello everyone! My name is Jake DeMonaco, I am 21 years old. I have live in Bayonne, New Jersey my entire life. I went to Saint Peter's Prep and Bayonne High School before college, and I attened Montcair State University and New Jersey City University for a combined 2 years. I hated every minute of it honestly, but so far I am really enjoying myself with the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program. It is challenging yet very satisfying.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="Order66">I have goals of starting my own game company one day, I have 3 games currently in production (all at different stages), and many more ideas lined up. I draw my own characters and write my own storeis. After graduation I will pursue a job under my newly earned certifications to fund my projects. Feel free to talk to me about anything that crosses your mind!</p>
